# Freshman-Programming-in-C-and-Python
I have uploaded the C and python codes for some of the assignments that I did in my spring semester under the course 'INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE' at IIT-Delhi.

a8) Sudoku solver in python.

a9) Program in C to calculate the number of birthdays a person would celebrate that fall on a Monday if they were born on XX-YY-ZZZZ which happened to be a Saturday and died on AA-BB-CCCC (DD-MM-YYYY).

a10) Implemented Singly Linked List Data Structure in C with built in functions similar to those in Python Lists.

a11) Implemented Binary Tree Data Structure in C to manage a company of employees(emp_id, subordinate_1, subordinate_2) with built in functions to access an employee, calculate the distance between two employees in the organisation, access the level and immediate team of an employee and its size, access all employees at the same level, find boss, find the diameter of the company(maximum distance between any two employees).

a12) Implemented Binary Tree Data Structure in C to manage a company of employees(emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, subordinate_1, subordinate_2), this time handling data about their names and salaries, with built in functions to get average salary of the team headed by an employee(all employees working under them including them), access all the bosses above the employee, access employees with same last name as a specific employee, find the first common boss of two employees.
